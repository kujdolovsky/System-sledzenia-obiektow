# 🎯 Object Tracking System (Pan-Tilt) using Computer Vision

## 📌 Overview
This project presents a real-time object tracking system based on a **pan-tilt platform (2 DOF)**.  
The system uses a camera and a laser pointer mounted on a movable structure driven by stepper motors.

Object detection and tracking are implemented using computer vision methods (**OpenCV + YOLO**), while control is based on a predictive approach to reduce delay and improve tracking accuracy.

## 📐 Predictive Controller Model (Simulink)
The controller estimates the future tracking error based on current object and platform position.  
This predicted error is then fed into a PID controller, which controls motor velocity.

More details available upon request.
